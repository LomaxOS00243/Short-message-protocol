**A GUI Java-based system for inter-process communication between clients and a server**

The system developed a message protocol to streamline client-server communications over TCP. It uses Stream-mode Sockets to support connection-oriented communication between client and server processes. It includes SSL/TLS protocol to establish secure connections and encrypt transmission links between the server and client processes and threads for the server to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
