Java system for client-server inter-process communication

THe system implements a Short Message Protocol (SMP) to streamline secure and concurrent client-server message exchange over TCP.
It is designed to be used in a multi-threaded environment, where multiple clients can connect to a server and exchange messages simultaneously.
Additionally, the system is designed to be secure, with the server waiting for TLS connections from clients, enabling the TLS handshake process.
