Java system for client-server inter-process communication

THe system implements a Short Message Protocol (SMP) to streamline secure and concurrent client-server message exchange over TCP.

Additionally, the system is designed to use SSL/TLS socket to encrypt transmission links, whihc enables TLS handshake.
